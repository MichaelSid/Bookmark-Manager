#install bcrypt?

#To talk to the database, we'll need the datamapper gem. It's an ORM (Object-relational mapper), which means that it's providing a convenient way 
#to interact with our data using classes and objects instead of working with database tables directly.
#Another advantage of datamapper is that is can be used with a variety of database engines, not only postgres. This 
#implies that we'll need to install an adapter to work with postgres, apart from the datamapper itself.
